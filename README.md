# Affirmations App (Android - Jetpack Compose)

A simple Android application built with Jetpack Compose that displays a list of inspiring affirmations. Each affirmation is presented as a card containing an image and its corresponding text.

## Features

*   Displays a scrollable list of affirmations.
*   Each affirmation includes an image and a textual description.
*   Built entirely using modern Android development tools:
    *   **Kotlin** as the programming language.
    *   **Jetpack Compose** for the UI.
    *   **Material Design 3** components for a modern look and feel.
    *   **`LazyColumn`** for efficient display of scrollable lists.
    *   **`Card`** composable for displaying each affirmation.
    *   Handles edge-to-edge display for a more immersive user experience.

## Project Purpose

This project serves as a demonstration of building a basic list-based application using Jetpack Compose. It showcases common patterns like:

*   Creating reusable composable functions (`AffirmationCard`, `AffirmationList`).
*   Loading data from a local data source (`Datasource`).
*   Using `Image`, `Text`, and layout composables (`Column`, `Modifier.padding`, `Modifier.fillMaxWidth`, etc.).
*   Implementing a `Scaffold` for basic app structure.
